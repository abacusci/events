# AbacusCI Events

This repository serves as the official log of public events, outreach activities, and institutional milestones at **Abacus Computing Institute (AbacusCI)**.

Each event is tracked transparently as a GitHub Issue, following our commitment to documentation, planning, and accountability — just like in real-world software development.

## 📘 Purpose

- Record and document all public-facing activities (e.g., open days, bootcamps, workshops, talks).
- Provide a transparent and permanent reference of institutional growth.
- Showcase our approach to project-based learning and professional workflow.

## 🧩 Structure

- Each **event** is created as a new GitHub **Issue**.
- Events are labeled, categorized, and linked to milestones and projects.
- Completed events are closed and archived with clear summaries and outcomes.

## ✅ Example
